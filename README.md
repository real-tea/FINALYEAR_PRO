[Hashdocs](https://hashdocs.org) is an open source Docsend alternative. We're building a more feature-rich secure document sharing and data room platform.

Sharing sensitive documents as attachments is risky and arcane. Attachments get forwarded all the time:

- You can't see and control who has access to your documents
- You can't track how long they spend on each page
- You can't revoke access to your documents
- You can't update your documents once they're sent


## Features

  - [x] Capture user emails and details prior to view

## Tech stack

Hashdocs is built entirely on open source tools. Weâ€™re deeply grateful to the contributors and maintainers of these tools for their incredible work. And we hope we can pay it forward

**Architecture**

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is an open-source Firebase alternative with an incredible feature-rich backend-as-a-service. We use Supabase for our database, authentication, edge functions and storage
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) is a React framework that provides hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. We use NextJS 13 (App router) for our frontend, hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
