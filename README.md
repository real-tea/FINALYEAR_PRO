[Hashdocs](https://hashdocs.org) is an open source Docsend alternative. We're building a more feature-rich secure document sharing and data room platform.

Sharing sensitive documents as attachments is risky and arcane. Attachments get forwarded all the time:

- You can't see and control who has access to your documents
- You can't track how long they spend on each page
- You can't revoke access to your documents
- You can't update your documents once they're sent
